`makemdb` is a suite tools managed by a single Makefile to create a PDF and ePub

## Why I created it

I wanted a way to create a pdf and have the ePub version be very similar
to it. For that reason, PP is used as macros to manage high quality images
in PDF and the correct representation in HTML of mini-sections(like Remark).
